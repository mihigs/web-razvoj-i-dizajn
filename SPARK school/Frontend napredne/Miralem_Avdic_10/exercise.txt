1. create the constructor function for a Video object. The function
should take in arguments of title (a string), uploader (a string, the
person who uploaded it), and seconds (a number, the duration), and it
should save them as properties of the object.
2. create a method on the Video object called watch(). When that
method is called, it should use console.log to output a string like "You
watched all 60 seconds of Otters Holding Hands!"
3. Instantiate a new Video object and call the watch() method on it.
4. Instantiate another Video object with different constructor
arguments.
5. bonus: use an array of data to instantiate 5 Video objects.
6. bonus: make the watch method accept amounts of seconds to watch
for, and call it with different amounts of seconds.
